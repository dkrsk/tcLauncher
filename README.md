# tcLauncher

Minecraft launcher powered on CMLib with some server stuffs


## How to setup modpack update on your server
+ First, set up your FTP server. You can use anonymous or normal access
+ Change the [tcLauncher/config.cs](https://github.com/dkrsk/tcLauncher/blob/master/tcLauncher/config.cs) file
+ Your modpack should be in [version name].zip format, where version name is integer. Each next version should be more by one (or by two, etc.)
+ Local version name located in gamePath/info file
+ Well done. <sub>*i want pizza*</sub>
